## Description

This is a proof of what I did in **[Missing Semester of the CS](https://missing.csail.mit.edu/)** thing. I am writing this becasue I want to keep a proof that I did this. It is not much useful to anyone but you can follow the webiste(https://missing.csail.mit.edu/) to get the real thing. Thanks to people at MIT who provide things for free.

## What I did and understand?
- Learned the basis stuff about cd, echo, cat, ls, man, rmdir, rm commands and how rmdir has a fail safe that prevents us from removing a directory with files in it.
- What are absolute paths and what are the relative path.
- How we can change the input and output to a specific commands using > and < and how we can pipe output of certain commands to the input of other commands.
- Learned how we can go into the sys place and then go into the class directory to change a bunch of things like the brightness of the screen. But was not able to do any of those things since I was on Windows Subsystem For Linux.
- Also learned about how to read the various things in the first column when we run the ls -l commands and how we can get the last lines using tail.
- Did the exercises of provided learned about the chmod command and how to make a file a executeable.
- I did not write the things at the time of lecture so do not remember much.
